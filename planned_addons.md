# Planned Addons
A list of planned addons that will be added to this repository.
## Advanced Lights
Add more light sources using custom player heads. Most player heads will come from [Freshcoal Heads](heads.freshcoal.com), and other sources which will be given proper credit.
- Candles and lanterns confirmed
- Possible heads: *mini-glowstone, lava*
- Perhaps add furniture-type light sources?
- Possibly include custom crafting recipes, though support for this may have to be through a third-party plugin.
## Nether Cult
Let's get rid of those boring Nether Portals and instead make rituals!
- Replace Nether Portals with ritualistic structures
- Require certain procedures to open a portal to the Nether
- Allow free passage from Nether to world, but not from world to Nether?
## Portal Catalyst
Teleportation items. How quaint.
- Give support for [Nether Cult](#nether-cult) by adding a special teleportation item for returning from the Nether to the portal in the overworld
- Basic teleportation item stuff.
- Include "personal" teleportation items (react as Essentials /sethome and /home)
- Add support for other teleportation plugins?
## GrandRPG
### GrandRPG Base
Add in a ton of things. Classes, races, tutorial areas, stats and leveling, etc.
- Planned races: *Human (obviously), Faerie, Nether, Pelagic*
- Planned classes: *Warrior, Mage, Ranger, Saboteur*
- Custom level-up system with custom EXP system
- Mana and health
- Add in-class advancements later down the road (e.g. Warrior **>** Knight **>** Royal Knight)
- Possibly allow adding more races and classes?
### GrandRPG Item Lores
Yet another lore attributes reader. Soft dependency on [GrandRPG Base](#grandrpg-base).
- Planned stats: *Damage, Defense, elemental Affinities (Flame, Ice, Wind, Earth, Light, Dark), Dodge, CRIT Chance, CRIT Damage, Reflect, Health, Attack Speed*
- Certain stats will have specific modifier types (for example, you can only add/subtract from CRIT Chance in percentages, not in flat numbers)
- Attack Speed stat may be excluded at first
- Include a set of "default" items
- Maybe allow customization of items via **YAML** files?
### GrandRPG Item Lores - Skill Expansion
Add more to [GrandRPG Item Lores](#grandrpg-item-lores) with skills being bound to items via the lore. Depends on [GrandRPG Item Lores](#grandrpg-item-lores).
- Planned default skills: *Leap, Smite, Fire/Ice/Wind/Earth/Light/Dark Bolt, Fire Ring, Ice Prison, Wind Cutter, Earthquake, Sanctuary (Light), Invisibility Cloak (Dark)*
- More default skills TBD
- Allow custom skills?
